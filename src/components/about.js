           <p>Hi everyone! I’m Lindsay, a seamstress and quilt pattern designer. My designs are inspired by folk art, traditional quilts made by my grandmother, and flowers… because, well, I just love flowers!</p>
           <p>My grandmother taught me to sew as a child. I would sit under her quilting frame with her fabric scraps and a needle and thread and create something of my own as she worked on a quilt.</p>
           <p>As a young adult I started making bags and quilts and shortly after that began working at a bridal shop as a seamstress. I learned so many tricks of the trade while working there. I left the bridal shop to start working in the medical field and that’s where I stayed for the next twelve years. I continued to sew occasionally and always wanted to branch out and have a business of my own. Finally in 2017 I began to focus on my sewing and creative work again. I started quilting for a modern quilting company, Vacilando Quilting Co., and began to realize again how much I love working with my hands. So, here we are! I’m sewing full time in Cincinnati, Ohio and spend my free time hanging out with my husband Jeremy and our cat!</p>
