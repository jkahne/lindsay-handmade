           <p>Hi everyone! I’m Lindsay, seamstress here at Lindsay Kahne Handmade, my custom sewing studio. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
           <p>My grandmother taught me to sew as a child. I would sit under her quilting frame with her fabric scraps and a needle and thread and create something of my own as she worked on a quilt. That something was usually pretty hideous in those days. </p>
           <p>As a young adult I started making bags and quilts and shortly after that began working at a bridal shop as a seamstress. I learned so many tricks of the trade while working there, not realizing at the time how valuable those lessons would be! I left the bridal shop to take an office job about a year later.  Money was tight and as a young single woman I thought it was time to pull up my boot straps and make a decent living. I ended up staying in the medical field for twelve years. I continued to sew occasionally and always wanted to branch out and have a business of my own. Finally in 2017 I began to focus on my sewing and creative work again. With some life changes in the cards (i.e. getting engaged and a pending move to the city), I thought it may be time to look at using my talents as a means of income. I took on some contract work as a quilter for a modern quilting company, Vacilando Quilting Co., and began to realize again how much I love working with my hands. So, here we are! I’m sewing full time in Cincinnati and spend my free time hanging out with my husband and our cat!</p>
           <p>Lindsay Kahne Handmade is my way of keeping the creativity flowing and also providing lessons for those who are also interested in diving into the sewing world. It can be so rewarding to see your idea come to fruition. Can’t wait to sew with you!</p>
